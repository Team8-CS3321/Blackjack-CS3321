# Blackjack Multiplayer  
  
> CS3321 Team 8 Project — Multiplayer Blackjack Game  
  
## Quick Start  
  
```bash  
# Clone repo (requires authentication)
gh repo clone Team8-CS3321/Blackjack-CS3321
cd Blackjack-CS3321

# Create virtual environment with dependencies(one-time)  
uv sync

# Login to doppler for team secrets  
doppler login  

# Setup Doppler configuration
doppler setup # Select "dev"
  
# Run the server  
doppler run -- uv run python .\src\app.py

# Open in browser  
http://localhost:3000  
```  
## Docker (WIP)
 ```bash
 # Build image
 docker build -t # blackjack-isu-cs3321-s26:<tag> .

# Run with secrets
doppler run -- docker run blackjack-isu-cs3321-s26
 ``` 

 ## Testing
 ```bash
 # Run unit tests
 uv run pytest

 # Get coverage report
 uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
 ```

## What's Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/app.py` | Quart + python-socketio server — rooms, join codes, player tracking, chat |
| `src/ChatGPTClient.py` | ChatGPT client for AI-powered blackjack advice and rule reminders |
| `src/game.py` | Core blackjack game logic and room management |
| `src/rules_and_objects.py` | Definitions for cards, deck, hands, players, and game rules |
| `public/index.html` | Retro ASCII-styled client — lobby, room view, chat |
| `pyproject.toml` | Dependencies: `quart`, `python-socketio`, `uvicorn`, `openai` |
  
## How It Works  
  
1. **Create a table** — server generates a 5-char room code (e.g., `K7F3P`)  
2. **Share the code** — other players enter it to join (up to 6 per room)  
3. **Chat** is scoped to the room  
4. **Ready toggle** per player (prep for game start logic)
